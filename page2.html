        <h2 style="text-align: left;">Importance of Patriotism</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Usually, we refer to our country as our motherland. <br>
            This further proves that we must have the same love for our country as we have for our mother.<br>
            After all, our country is no less than a mother; it nurtures us and helps us grow. <br>
            Everyone must possess the virtue of patriotism as it makes it better. <br></p>
