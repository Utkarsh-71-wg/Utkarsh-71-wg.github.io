        <h2 style="text-align: left;">Sarojini Naidu (Some Indian patriots)</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Patriotism all about the love that an individual has for his nation. <br> 
         A country's greatness lies in its undying ideals of love and sacrifice that inspire the mothers of the race. When there is oppression, the only self-respecting thing is to rise and say this shall cease today, because my right is justice.<br>
        One must put all his efforts to make his country a better place to live <br>
         Sarojini Naidu-Remembered as the Nightingale of India, poet and social activist Sarojini Naidu made significant contributions during the independence struggle of India. Sarojini Naidu was the first woman to be elected as the governor of an Indian state and the Indian National Congress. She traveled across different states delivering speeches on social welfare and her poetry became the medium of sending out the message of independence.
